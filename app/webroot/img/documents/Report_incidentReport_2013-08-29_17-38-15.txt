What I need to happen is when I set-up a customer, then login to type up a report, hit submit and have the entire report go in email format to a specific email address. 

Sorry I also need to see the attached “Type of Incident” all options in the drop down for the Incident Report.  Is it possible to add this somehow?  So it would need to be Report … Incident Report … then these categories as types of incident reports.
