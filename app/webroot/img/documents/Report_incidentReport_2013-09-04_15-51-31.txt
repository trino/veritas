BUGS

- food Items don't move up sometimes in the menu (having trouble with Guirei menu because item's have an actual code number so they need to be in order)
- need to place the approval back in for new restaurants
- the statistics section of the admin panel still doesn't work properly, errors between the results for each month and the actual reservations that month

when editing item  the complimentary items dont show up

in the email, have party size

if you dont type in name and email... it takes you in as the host

if you dont complete menu, do not show in digital receipt....



CHANGES

- need to highlight that our service has "No fees" maybe write "Full Service Reservations - No Fees" where you use to have the motto at the top
 - please figure out a way to integrate that into home page, we think it might be    a barrier from ppl trying our service

- THE VIEW MENU FEATURE - people are getting confused when they click this, thinking they can add items and make a reservation even with the live reservation link on the side - its not noticable enough
- POTENTIAL FIXES - take off the qty and ADD from this version of the menu
- Make a pop up appear that says you need to click on live reservation before you can place an order if someone tries to add an item
- anything else you can think of to fix this problem - we've got this particular problem with a lot of users!

That's it for now, haven't found any new bugs or anything


Currently 10 people have orders, but no one else is being allowed on. (max party size reached)
