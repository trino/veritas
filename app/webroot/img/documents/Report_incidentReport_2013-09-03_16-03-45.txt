- when you click on one of the popular restaurants - it opens a new page, can we avoid that? OPEN SAME PAGE

- The email that says your reservation was approved - change script to

Hello,

Your reservation with Dine N' Dash was approved. Please visit www.dinendash.ca to view your reservation details, or to make any changes. You can still invite guests to your reservation using the provided booking ID. (Insert Booking ID)

- Can we make sure that the booking ID, is included in the approval email?



- Also, when the discount/promotions are applied, they only apply to one person. For instance, if Rony and Matt both have orders, and Rony's order meets a promotion requirement of $500 minimum for 10% off, 
only Rony will get the discount, and the discount won't show up on Matt's order as well. I THINK THIS IS HOW IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE? -VAN


- on the menu/order page, maybe at the bottom could we add
"For allergy information, please contact the restaurant directly."



-The same way that you made the menu (hovering over an item shows a box with pic/info), can we do that with the 3 steps on the home page (only text).

Step 1 - Start by entering either the name of the restaurant you are looking for, the type of cuisine, or the location in the search box. A list of our carefully selected restaurants will be populated for your choosing.

Step 2 - We let you order as little or as much as you would like to eat at the restaurant prior to your arrival. This speeds up service so you can enjoy a gourmet meal without the wait.

Step 3 - Once you've made a reservation, you can invite your guests by providing them with the unique booking ID. This will allow them to independently add their orders to your existing reservation, and make group dining a breeze.



- The last thing is the "Redefining Dining" at the bottom of the screen. - looks terrible, can we take out the Dine N Dash >>>> part and the quotations as well. Could you just write Redefining Dining there in bigger letters.


The restaurant manager shows all of the reservations, even the ones that were cancelled or not approved yet. It should only show approved reservations! 
Also the number of guests are not accurate, and in some of the totals, they total $ only reflects the host's order. 
Lastly, there are reservations which say that they have two hosts? The layout and organization of the page is perfect, we just need it to be accurate as well.
